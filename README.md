# GOAP-AI Unity 6 Example

## About GOAP
This repository is to display the GOAP system and how it can be achieved in Unity 6 using C#. GOAP stands for Goal Orientated Action Planning and is an artificial intelligence system for autonomous agents that allows them to dynamically plan a sequence of actions to satisfy a set goal [(ref)](https://medium.com/@vedantchaudhari/goal-oriented-action-planning-34035ed40d0b). 
 
GOAP is used in many systematic and simulation games, such as the Sims (Electronic Arts) or City Skylines (Colossal Order). GOAP seperates tasks and goals into modular steps which can be modified or changed at runtime. This creates an intelligent AI system which appears sentient.
